# ml_paper_club
A repository of papers accompanying AICamp's machine learning paper club.

## Joining Instructions ##

Whilst the COVID-19 quarantine lasts we will be conducting ML Paper Club remotely. Same day (), same time (18h00 London), but via webinar. Every week, we will post a link next to the paper so that you can join at the time of the Meetup. The link will be posted here a few minutes before the start of the discussion. Bear in mind that these meetings may be recorded for dissemination purposes.

During the discussion:
- Raise your (virtual) hand if you want to speak.
- Post in the Q&A section if you want something answered by the speaker.
- Feel free to make comments in the chat.

## YouTube channel ##

We regularly record the presentations made during the [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-AI-Tech-Talk/) (subject to the presenter's and attendees' approval). These videos are then uploaded to our [YouTube channel]() so that those that can't attend are still able to profit from the presentations.
